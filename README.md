## Live-Demo
https://popcoorn.netlify.app/   
Feel free to play around there as much as you like (everything is reset at night)  
We will keep this demo updated with our newest releases as they come, so that you can check out new features there first before deciding to deploy them in your own environments. 

# Technical Details
This application is web-based, For all the front-end components, [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) is used and the player is completely HTML5-based. The application is essentially split into Grails for a REST-API, and ReactJs for the frontend.

Popcorn uses the [awesome API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) from [theMovieDatabase](https://www.themoviedb.org) for all media-metadata.

# Roadmap
Popcorn is still very much a work-in-progress. We will be adding new features and bug-fixes often, but this is a hobby project for the core-contributors, so the time that we can spend on it is limited.

For all our feature and bug tracking, we use the [Issues Section](https://github.com/AzouKr/Movie-Streaming-Site/issues). Popcorn's 'roadmap' is currently to work through the feature requests and improvements that are in the issue tracker.  Take a look at the milestones for what we intend to add for upcoming releases.
